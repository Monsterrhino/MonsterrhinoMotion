# MonsterrhinoMotion

## Introduction
The MonsterrhinoMotion card is an independent stepper motor driver card to power and control up to 4 stepper motors that comes with a pre-installed firmware. The MonsterrhinoMotion card uses high quality stepper drivers (TMC5160) from Trinamic.
You can use Monsterrhino Motion in different ways depending on the complexity of your project: 

- Use the pre-installed library by sending commands **over a serial USB port** using a variety of predefined functions (see below)
- Use the pre-installed library by sending commands **over CAN bus** using a variety of predefined functions (see in the MonsterrhinoControl documentation)
- Program functions and actions with the **provided Arduino library** and upload directly to the card

In the simplest case all you need to do is **just connect 24V, a stepper motor and a USB cable** to the Monsterrhino Motion and you are ready to move the motor - **plug and play**.

The key features of the MonsterrhinoMotion stepper driver card are:

- up to 4 stepper motors
- two limit switches per motor
- encoder for each stepper motor
- up 12 digital inputs (24V)
- 1 digital output (24V)
- 3 PWM outputs (open collector)
- 2 CAN bus connector 
- USB C connector
- micro USB connector
- analog emergency power-off circuit that can be bridged with a jumper

## USB serial communication

### Connect to Monsterrhino Motion

Install the Arduino IDE on your computer (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Open the Arduino IDE on your computer. 

+ Select the right port under **Tools->Port** e.g. /dev/ttyACM0 or COM5. 
+ Open the serial monitor and set **115200 baud** and line ending to **Both NL & CR**.

  <br><br>


Press the reset button on the Monsterrhino Motion than your ready to type your first command. If you have Motor 1 connected you can for example type: **m1mr 100** into the serial monitor and hit enter - now Motor 1 should move 1000 steps (that is 5 rotations - 200 steps per rotation or 1.8Â° per step). The meaning of this command is: **m1** - motor 1, **mr** move relative, **1000** - hundred steps. With **m1mr -1000** you can move 1000 steps into the other direction.

### Commands
The MonsterrhinoMotion commands are combinations of commands from the list below. They are composed of the classifier: **m, i or f**. A number after the classifier letter selects the desired motor, input, or function: Motor 1 = **m1**, Userfunction 1 = **f1**. The classifier is followed by a function such as targetposition = **tp** and a number.

- **m1tp 100** - motor 1 move to target position 100
- **m4ma 200** - motor 4 set motor current to 200 mA
- **m3smp** - motor 3 save motor parameters
- **m2cp ?** - request motor 2 current position

The questionmark can generally be used to request a current value e.g. Motor 1 what is the current position = **m1tp ?**.

<br><br>

* Open VisualStudio and press **Continue without code** and then go to **File->Open->Arduino Project** and navigate to ```..\Arduino\libraries\Monsterrhinostep-Lib\examples\monsterrhinostep\monsterrhino.ino```
* Adjust the vMicro settings (**Extensions -> vMicro**) to the same values as you did in your Arduino IDE (see **adjust the Arduino IDE settings like follows** above)
* Open Visual Studio, open **Extensions -> vMicro -> ViewPortMonitor ** (Monsterrhino needs to be connected to your computer to be able to open it), switch the setting **line endings** to **Both CR & LF**
* You can now use the ViewPortMonitor to connect to your Monsterrhino and directly send commands 
* To use Visual Studio to compile and upload your code to your Monsterrhino, you first have to restart it in debug mode (keep debug button pushed while pressing the reset button)


## On Ubuntu 
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04. 

* Install the Arduino IDE (tested with version 1.8.12)
* In the Arduino IDE go to **Properties/Additional BoardsManager** and add following 

  ```https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json ```
  
* Under **Arduino/Boardsmanager** add ```stm32 cores```.
* Install the Java Runtime Environment by executing the following command in your terminal ```sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre```.
* Download and install the **STM32CubeProgrammer**. There might be problems with JavaFX, you can try this fix https://askubuntu.com/a/1316213.


  **Attention**
  Check if you can open the **STM32CubeProgrammer** and connect to your MonsterrhinoMotion. Select USB and bring your MonsterrhinoMotion into boot-mode by pressing reset while holding down the boot button. It might be usefull to open the **STM32CubeProgrammer** via the terminal, so you get some information if something is not right.
  
  **Note**
  If in your terminal you read something about **permission denied** it might be necessary to copy a rules.d file to the STM32 folder. To do so you can follow this instructions (taken from: https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W000000aP9J/no-stm32-device-in-dfu-mode-connected): 
  
  * Make sure you have installed this library: ```sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0```
  * To allow STM32CubeProgrammer to access the USB port through low-level commands, proceed as follows: 
  ```cd $HOME/STM32MPU_workspace/STM32MPU-Tools/STM32CubeProgrammer-x.y.z/Drivers/rules```
  * Then execute: ```sudo cp *.* /etc/udev/rules.d/```
  * Restart the STM32CubeProgrammer 
  
  **After successfully connecting** to your device you should see something similar to:
  
    <br><br>
